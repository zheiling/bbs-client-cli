# Bulletin Board System (Client Side)
This is my sandbox project. I made it test and develop my programming skills. Maybe one day it become a mature and production-ready project.

## Setup
1. Create necessary file structure by running `$ ./setup.sh`.
It will create all necessary file structure in order to run the program correctly. 

2. Build the binary running `$ make` or `$ make bbs-client`
3. Run it by `$ make run`
